# Couchbase Spark Connector <br>
<br>
This has a few getting started samples showing the integration between Couchbase and Spark. 
<br>
The slide deck is a general overview of the technologies. The current version is a rough draft.
<br>
The directory DockerDemo contains docker-compose environment that will build a single node of Couchbase, a master and a slave spark node. The Couchbase connector should be running on the master.
